# competition overview

fll is one of four FIRST programs. The others are FLL jr, FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge), and FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition)

## what is fll?

FIRST Lego League (FLL) is a program for students in grades 4-8 in which teams of up to 10 kids must work together to solve problems and challenges related to STEM. Starting in late August, students build and program a Lego Mindstorms robot to complete a series of missions on a table-top playing field. Team members must also design an innovative solution to a problem related to that yearâ€™s theme by researching physical and online resources as well as talking to experts in that field. At the end of the 8 week build season, teams compete in a qualifying tournament with other local teams where students showcase their robot and present their project.

## teams

FLL teams feature kids in grades 4-8 who are under 15 years old. There can be a maximum of ten students on one team, but many teams have less than ten students and can be as small as just three or four kids. Some schools have multiple FLL teams, but a student may only be on one team. Two adults coach each team, and adults can coach multiple teams. Parents can also help; however, students must do all the work on the robot and the project. The adults can facilitate and instruct, but the students should come up with and execute the ideas.

## qualifying tournaments

All teams attend one qualifying competition in November. The event lasts the entire day and all team members must be present at each event. Teams will compete with their robot multiple times throughout the day, and the scores are averaged across each attempt. The team also attends multiple judging sessions. They have 5 minutes to present their project. There is also robot design judging, where team members describe the robot and how they designed it. Finally there is Core Values Judging, where team members have to work together as a team and demonstrate how they used the core values during the season.

## season structure

The season kickoff is August 30, when the challenge documents are released. That marks the start of the 8 week build season. Teams typically meet around twice a week for 1-2 hours per meeting, but teams can meet more or less frequently depending on the program. Some teams have one meeting for the robot component and one for the project, but other teams do both in the same meeting. Qualifiers are in November, and NorCal Championships are in January. Registration is open in the summer and will typically stay open through September, but registration will close when all of the qualifier spots are filled.

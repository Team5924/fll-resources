# motors

ev3 robots use two main motors: the large and medium servo motors

## large servo motor

large motor features:

* **160-170rpm**
* **20N.cm** running torque
* **40N.cm** stall torque
* built in sensor for one degree accuracy

the large motor is ideal for applications like driving a robot. it's slower than the medium motor but much more powerful with roughly 3x the torque.

## medium servo motor

medium motor features:

* **240-250rpm**
* **8N.cm** running torque
* **12N.cm** stall torque
* built in sensor for one degree accuracy

the medium motor is ideal for applications when loads are low and high rpm is needed. it also has a smaller profile than the large motor

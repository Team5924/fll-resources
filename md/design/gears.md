# gears

gears are mechanical devices that use teeth to transfer motion

gears serve a critical role in robots. usually we'll use them for getting more speed or torque out of a motor, but they have many uses.

## gear ratio

the ratio of the pitch diameters of the gears determines the gear ratio. for example, gearing a 100rpm, 20N.cm input at 2:1 will double torque (40N.cm) and halve rpm (50) on the output.

## types of gears

### spur gear

spur gears are common and simple. the gears only mesh when their shafts are parallel

### worm gear

one of the benefits of a worm gear is that its geeometry doesn't allow it to be backdriven
